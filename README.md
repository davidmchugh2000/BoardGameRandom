Board Game Randomizer in Expo 

After working in React-Native for a few months because of school, I decided it was time to do an individual project using React. This idea came from my roommate when he randomly asked for the best way to select board games from our extensive collection. I decided to go with Expo to gather experience with the framework as I wanted a slightly different experience than basic React-Native. I plan to publish this app in the future as I slowly work on it.
